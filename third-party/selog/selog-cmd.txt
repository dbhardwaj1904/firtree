NAME
       selog - selective logging tool

SYNOPSIS
       selog [config] <category> <level> <message> ...

DESCRIPTION
       Selog  provides  a shell command interface to the selog(3) library.  It
       takes the following arguments:

       config The first argument is an optional  selog  configuration  string.
              Its  presence  is recognozed if it starts with "-", "+", or "@".
              See selog(7) for details.

       category
              The selector category name of the message to be logged.

       level  The level of the message to be logged.

       message
              The remaining arguments are joined using spaces to  produce  the
              message that is to be logged.

EXIT STATUS
       By  default,  selog  exits  with  a  status of zero, though this can be
       changed to n using a level setting of "fatal(n)".  You can  make  selog
       dump core using an "abort" level setting.

       Selog  exits  with a status of 1 if there is a problem with the command
       line.  If the config is invalid then a  message  is  logged  using  the
       {log_config,  ERROR} selector.  If there are not enough arguments or if
       the level is invalid, then a message is logged using the {usage, FATAL}
       selector.
