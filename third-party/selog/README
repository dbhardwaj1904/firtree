Selog - selective logging
-------------------------

Selog is a library of routines that unifies error reporting, activity
logging, and debug tracing. It allows programmers to give their users
flexible control over which messages are written and where they are
written to.

Installation notes

To build selog, type "make". At the moment the makefile requires gcc
and gnu binutils, though with any luck you should be able to get other
compilers to work by adjusting the CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and SOFLAG make
variables.

To install selog under /usr/local, type "make install". To install in
another place, type "make install PREFIX=/another/place". You can get
finer control over installation by setting the BINDIR, LIBDIR, and
MANDIR variables in a similar way.

To build the Lua binding, type "make lua", and to install it, type
"make lua-install". You can add a -I option to EXTRACFLAGS if your Lua
headers are not in a standard location. You can set LUADIR to control
where the Lua extension is installed.
