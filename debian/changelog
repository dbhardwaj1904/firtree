libfirtree (0.0.5-0ubuntu1~ppa1) hardy; urgency=low

  * NEW: Added the Python-based 'playgorund' example which shows how to make a
    generic filter-oriented image processing pipeline using Firtree.

  * NEW: ImageAccumulator and friends are more picky about there being a n
    OpenGLContext 'current'. Dlowly migrating all the examples over to 'best
    practise' of making sure that a context is created, even if it is only a
    NULL context.

  * NEW: Added a software-only rendering backend based on libOSMesa. This
    necessitated moving all the GL API entry points inside the OpenGLContext
    structure. Hence there *must* always be a context current when Firtree
    calls are made.

  * BUG FIX: In the kernel language, 'foo.x' et al are all lvalues which can
    be assigned to. The GLSL backend was translating swizzles in such a way
    that assignment to them was in effect a NOP.

  * API CHANGE: ImageProvders now have the semantic of 'creating' a
    BitmapImageRep on demand, even if this only involves returning an internal
    cached rep and incrementing its reference count. This brings it more into
    line with Firtree's object ownership conventions.

  * BUG FIX: ImageProviders have no way, currently, of signalling a 'dirty'
    bit on their BitmapImageRep and so each time they are used we now copy the
    image to the GPU. This is highly sub-optimal and a good signalling method
    must be found but it does ensure that changing the bitmap returned by an
    ImageProvider changes what ends up on screen.

  * BUG FIX: Blob lengths were never being set internally.

  * NEW: Added a skeleton API for converting pixel formats into the RGBA form
    expected by Firtree. Currently only supports 8-bit luminance values.

  * NEW: Long-standing feature need. When creating a kernel, syntax errors in
    the kernel source now throw an exception including the error.
